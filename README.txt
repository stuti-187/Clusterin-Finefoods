How to run?
—Please download the data http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-FineFoods.html and put it in the folder.
—Open this project folder in the terminal
—Run command python hw2p3.py 
—Output produced on the terminal will be the top 5 words in each cluster with their feature values
—A file with name top500.csv will be generated which will include all the top 500 words in the data and their count.

Note: Since the code take few minutes to run, for your convenience I have put the output of top 5 words and their feature values from each cluster in the file top50WordsEachCluster.txt
